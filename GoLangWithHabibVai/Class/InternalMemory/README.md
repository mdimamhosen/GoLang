# Detailed Note on the Go Code

## Overview

This Go program demonstrates basic functions, the `main` function, and the `init` function. It includes a simple addition function and prints the results to the console.

## Code Breakdown

### Package Declaration

```go
package main
```

Every Go program starts with a package declaration. The `main` package is a special package that tells the Go compiler that the program is an executable program.

### Addition Function

```go
func add(a, b int) int {
    return a + b
}
```

This function named `add` takes two integers as parameters and returns their sum. It is a simple example of a function in Go.

### Main Function

```go
func main() {
    add := add(1, 2)
    println(add)
}
```

The `main` function is the entry point of the program. When the program is executed, the `main` function is called first. Here, the `add` function is called with arguments `1` and `2`, and the result is assigned to a variable named `add`. The result is then printed to the console using `println`.

### Init Function

```go
func init() {
    println("init")
}
```

The `init` function is a special function in Go that is called before the `main` function. It is typically used for initialization tasks. In this example, it simply prints "init" to the console.

## Execution Flow

1. The `init` function is called first, printing "init".
2. The `main` function is called next.
3. Inside `main`, the `add` function is called with `1` and `2` as arguments.
4. The result of the addition is printed to the console.

## Summary

This program demonstrates the basic structure of a Go program, including package declaration, functions, and the special `init` and `main` functions. It shows how to define and call a function, and how to print output to the console.
